# Processor Definition
PROCESSOR_DOMAIN=${project.groupId}
PROCESSOR_NAME=${project.artifactId}
PROCESSOR_LABEL=Delay Processor
PROCESSOR_DESC=Release ${project.release}: Delays the processing of events by a specified amount of time. All delayed events are held in a sorted queue in memory. The queue is sorted by event time (based on the time field selected). <p><b>To clear the GeoEvent queue</b> Restart the service.<p><b>To clear the duplicate key cache</b> change any one of Updates Allowed, Use TRACK_ID, or Delay Time Field and save your changes (then change it back if you like). <p>Examples:<p><b>Time Field = RECEIVED_TIME, Allow Duplicates = Yes, Use TRACK_ID = No</b><br>These settings will simply delay every event by the delay time.<p><b>Time Field = TIME_START, Allow Duplicates = No, Use TRACK_ID = No</b><br>These settings will use the TIME_START value to determine if an event has already been received with the same start time value. If an event has an identical value for TIME_START to a previous event, the current event will be dropped.<p><b>Time Field = TIME_START, Allow Duplicates = No, Use TRACK_ID = Yes</b><br>These settings will use the TRACK_ID and the TIME_START values to determine if an event has already been received with those same values. If an event has identical values for both TRACK_ID and TIME_START to a previous event, the current event will be dropped.

# Processor Properties
ALLOW_DUPLICATES_DESC=Should new events with the same timestamp as an event already in the queue be allowed to be added to the queue? If duplicates are allowed, multiple events with the same timestamp may enter the queue.
ALLOW_DUPLICATES_LABEL=Allow Duplicates?
CLEAR_CACHE_DESC=Yes will clear the cache of events used to determine duplicates.
CLEAR_CACHE_LABEL=Clear Cache?
DELAY_TIME_DESC=Specify a delay value. GeoEvents will be delayed by this value before they are further processed.
DELAY_TIME_FIELD_DESC=Choose the field that the delay time will be added to.
DELAY_TIME_FIELD_LABEL=Delay Time Field
DELAY_TIME_LABEL=Delay Time
DELAY_TIME_UNIT_DESC=Choose the time unit for the delay value
DELAY_TIME_UNIT_LABEL=Delay Time Unit
ENFORCE_DELAY_THRESH_DESC=Setting this to yes will cause any events with a timestamp earlier than the current delay (now-delay) to be discarded (no events will ever be in the queue that are older than the current delay). Setting this to no will allow all events to be time ordered.
ENFORCE_DELAY_THRESH_LABEL=Enforce Delay Threshold
USE_LOCATION_DESC=Should new events with the same location as an event already in the queue be allowed to be added to the queue? If duplicates are allowed, multiple events with the same location may enter the queue. NOTE: This only works for points.
USE_LOCATION_LABEL=Use Location?
USE_TRACKID_DESC=Should each unique TRACK_ID get its own queue, or should all events be stored in a single queue.
USE_TRACKID_LABEL=Use TRACK_ID?
